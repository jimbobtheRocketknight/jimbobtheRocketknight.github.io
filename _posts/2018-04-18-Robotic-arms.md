  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by copying out the book and then trying to comprehend what the code actually did.This was made more difficult as people around me just wanted to play with the robotic arm.I also learnt from the failure of other people in the previous lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact that I sit in an area of the classroom that there are a lot of people who will distract me making it harder for me to focus.I also think that if I had spent more time on the LED lights then I would have learnt more over the course of the lesson.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will choose to sit in a quieter part of the classroom out of the way of all the distractions that I currently have around me.I will also try and work more things out for myself rather than just read the book which meant that I didn't learn as much as I could have if I had worked everything out for myself.</td>
