  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A decent blog with a basic container and no text shadowing.It also had colours that don't go very well together.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create a professional looking blog that is worthy of full marks.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by looking things up on the internet to find out the code that I needed.This meant that I could do most things that I wanted to.It also helped to read through my code a couple of times as this helped me to understand what I had done with my edits.Trial and error at times also worked very well as it meant that I covered a wide range of things that could be correct so one of them was bound to be right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact that I spent too long trying to do things that I did not know how to do. For example I was trying to remove a line from my blog that I didn't like which took 20 minutes.However much I tried I didn’t know the code so it wasted a lot of time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will stay within the capabilities of my coding. This will mean that I don’t waste time unnecessarily and I get more done.Even though it would take time I will still look to push myself when possible.</td>
  </tr>
