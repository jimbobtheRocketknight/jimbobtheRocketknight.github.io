  <tr>
    <td>I found the strategy of read through the task given and how to do it and then do it an effective strategy.I also found it effective to try and work things out by doing things 1 at a time rather than doing it all at once.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I tried to do everything really quickly rather that read through every single piece of information and try to work out what it all does and means.This is because I didn't learn as much as I would have if I had done things a lot slower due to the fact that I had less time to take in information.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will use the same methods but I will spend a lot more time thinking things through and not press the solve button at all.If I find it to hard then I will google it and not press the solve.</td>
