  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by doing the obvious and what I already knew how to do.This was by doing what I learnt in previous lessons and saving it on a memory stick which I could already do.I also learnt by reading what the leaflet said and coppying out the code onto the fuze spreadsheet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my learning was limited by the person who I was working with as they kept distracting me.This meant that I ended up talking about irrelevant things which sincerely reduced the amount I learnt in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will ignore the person I was working with and keep on doing what I was doing.I will also try and bring myself back to the relevant topic when I am distracted by people who are messing around.I will also improve my learning by being more efficient so that I can work on other things and learn more overall.</td>
