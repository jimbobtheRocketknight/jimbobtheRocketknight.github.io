    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by comparing what I had done to what it said in the book.I also had a look at other people's work so that I could see what I was missing in mine.This helped as it meant that I was inferring meaning I was learning a lot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I didnâ€™t copy out the book precisely enough.This is because I wrote the variable age in capitals whereas in the book it said that I was meant to write the A in capitals and the other 2 in lowercase letters.That wasted 20 minutes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I copy out what the book says precisely and only change small things continually checking the code works as I am working to minimize the chance of making a mistake and messing up my work.</td>
