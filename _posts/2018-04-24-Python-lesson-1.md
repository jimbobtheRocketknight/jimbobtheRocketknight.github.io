    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had small parts of HTML and Java from my primary school that I vaguely remembered but had no prior uses of python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete at least 75% of the first part of the python course and to get a basic understanding of strings and variables.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I did 85% of the first part of the python course and learnt the basics of string text as well as how to do calculations with python.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by slowly reading through the instructions for the task I was doing.This meant that I got all the necessary information from the task and learnt how to do it.I also learnt from the fact that the codecademy program did things over and over again as well as incorporating old things into new so the key parts of how to do python stuck in my memory and I learnt how to do the programming language.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited due to the fact that I was a bit inefficient.This is because I read through things slowly which helped me learn one specific are of python to extreme detail but meant that I didn't move onto newer topics very quickly.My learning was also limited as I overthought certain aspects of python.This meant that I got stuck at certain points and that took up extra time or meant that I had to use the hint which gifted me part of the answer and stopping me having to work it out which would have aided my learning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will skim read the task and then if I don’t get it I will read it a bit more thoroughly as this will save time letting me move on and learn other key parts of python.I will also look at a task compare it to what I already know and then think about it as this will help me see the obvious things that I wouldn’t usually notice due to me overthinking that task.</td>
