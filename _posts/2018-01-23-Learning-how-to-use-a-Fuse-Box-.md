    <td>Never used a fuse box before.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have a basic understanding of how a fuse box works and to get it to say hello world.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I managed to get the fuzebox to say a variety of things in different colours and with different backgrounds.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the provided leaflet that came with the fuse box.It said how all the code worked.I found out that you need to type cycle at the start that tells it to show what you are going to type.You then need to type print that tells it to show words and after that if you say repeat it will do it again and again until you press esc which will stop it from repeating.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think my learning was limited by the fact that I spent ages doing what I already knew how to do rather than trying to understand more complex code for fuse box.This meant that I didn't learn as much as I could from the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and push what I can do so I can do more complex coding even though that would be risking breaking what I have already done.</td>
