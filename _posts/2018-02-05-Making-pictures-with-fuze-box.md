  <tr>
    <td>I learned by copying what the book said.This meant I had an example of working code in front of me and I could figure out what each piece of code does.This meant I learnt how to create an image.I learnt that the pictures are made using binary .There are 8 columns and the number you put in defines which column it puts a coloured in square in.The coloured squares together make a picture.It is done by typing defchar then in brackets the numbers showing which squares are coloured in in which column.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I did nothing for certain periods of the lesson.This was because I was satisfied with what I had done at certain points and were willing to just look at it rather than trying to push myself and do better things on fuze box which would have increased the amount of things that I had done in the lesson.</td>

    <td>Next time I will always look to improve with all aspects of IT and never just sit there doing nothing.</td>
