    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No,I did not as I did not finish any assessments due to the fact that i was unable to program basic greetings and be able to change the.Therefore I did not get on to programming LED lights.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by copying out the book this meant that I had a basic example to try and learn from.I also learnt by failing which meant I knew what didn't work so I learnt.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I didnâ€™t spend enough time trying to understand what was going on in my programming.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will spend more time trying to link all the things that I have done and understanding it so I am able to work out more complex bits of coding.</td>
