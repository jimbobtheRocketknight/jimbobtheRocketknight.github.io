  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I started off with a small bit of knowledge on how to program variable.Iwas able to get the fuze box to say I have 6 apples and then say if we eat one.Then it would fail</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to program a  piece of code that successfully reduce the first number continuously and does not fail.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I was able to get it to say the correct sequence of code continuously without failures or line errors.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading from the book and seeing what other people have done.I also used the internet to help me.This meant that by the end of the lesson I had a much better understanding on how to program variables on fuze box.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I spent too much time trying to improve my github blog rather than doing the work that was set.This meant that I did not get on to doing more advanced things than variables.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve my learning by being a bit more questioning of what I have done so I have better quality work in the end.This will help me to improve in the long term.</td>
  </tr>
