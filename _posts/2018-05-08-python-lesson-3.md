    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited due to the fact that I spent a lot of time talking rather than working which hindranced the amount of work that I completed over the period of the lesson.Even though about half of the talk was about the work I still donâ€™t think that it helped me so therefore it limited my learning.</td>

    <td>Next time I will spend less time talking and to try and help me do this I might try and sit further away from the people that I was talking to as this is the main reason that I got distracted.</td>
