(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by copying out big chunks of code from the book and then changing small things and seeing what the difference is when I change them and do that continuously until I know what I am doing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I didn't use all the resources around me to try and work out what certain things mean as I couldâ€™ve googled certain things to try and find out what they mean so I know a bit about what I was typing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will use all the resources around me and try and wok a bit more efficiently.</td>
